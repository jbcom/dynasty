# Continuous Work Directive — Dynasty (maga-money-moves)

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** jbogaty (autonomous loop)
**Mandate (2026-06-21):** POLISH & FEATURES — AUTONOMOUS LOOP. Foundations done:
found-your-own / diegetic birth / orthogonal identity (PR #31), 1000-year dynasty breadth
+ GenAI toolkit + millennium run (PRs #34/#35). User directive (`/loop`): "add features
and improvements, polish the UI and UX, expand and compress directives — do this
AUTONOMOUSLY, make decisions, mutate your own loop prompt as you discover new content to
go in the direction of." So: self-pace; pick the highest-value improvement each cycle;
own the full PR loop; keep the directive a living plan (expand when discovery reveals
work, compress when items resolve). Work SERIALLY, no agent swarm
([[agent-swarm-discipline]]). Every change stays 0-leak + 0-harness-findings + green CI.
EXPANSION milestone (EX-1→EX-6) RELEASED — see git history / directive-archive.md.

## What CONTINUOUS means
1. Never stop for status reports the user didn't ask for. 2. Never stop for scope
caution. 3. Never stop to summarize. 4. Never stop on context pressure. 5. Never stop
because a task feels big. 6. Only stop on: explicit user halt, red CI blocking, or a
genuine scope-flip design question (ask, then continue).

## Operating loop
while queue has [ ] items: enumerate use-cases → docs/tests/code → verify (typecheck +
biome check + full suite + harness audit at 0 findings, screenshot/live-verify UI) →
commit (Conventional Commit, one per item) → dispatch reviewers → mark [x] → next.

## Forbidden phrases / behaviors
"deferred" | "v2+" | "out of scope" | "future work" | "follow-up" | "TODO" | "FIXME" |
"stub" | "placeholder" | "mock for now" | "pause point" | "next session" | "stopping
point" | "clean handoff". No Math.random/Date.now in src/sim (purity). No commit to main.
Squash-merge only. Stubs/`as any`/`it.todo` are bugs. Run `pnpm format` + `biome check`
(not just `pnpm lint`) before push — CI gates on format + import-sort.

## Milestone — POLISH & FEATURES (batch-20260621-polish, autonomous loop)

GOAL: continuously raise the quality of the shipped game — UI/UX polish, UX affordances,
and well-scoped feature additions — one PR per improvement, each green + 0-leak. The
queue is a LIVING discovery list: I add items as I find them (playing the game, reading
the code, screenshotting), and compress (mark [x] / remove) as they ship. Each loop cycle
picks the current highest-value [ ] item.

### Queue (living — expand on discovery, compress on completion)
- [x] **PL-1 Title wordmark divider overlap — FIXED** (commit e78db40). h1 descender bled
  into the ornamental rule (tight line-height clipped the line-box); added
  `padding-bottom:0.18em`. Verified via visual test + live screenshot.
- [ ] **PL-2 Meter-change delta feedback.** The gauges animate the arc + pulse on crit, but
  show NO delta when a meter moves after a choice — so the cause→effect (the core
  butterfly mechanic) is invisible. Add a brief `+N`/`−N` badge (gold-up / crit-down) that
  appears on the gauge when its value changes, then fades. Discovered while playtesting the
  PlayScreen this cycle.

## Architectural notes carried forward
- Identity = PLACE × CULTURE × ERA × ARCHETYPE; names from the live family tree via
  `runTerms`; NO literal presets (the harness validator enforces 0 preset-person leaks).
- Eras: `eras/<place>/<period>/events.json`, glob-loaded; `_shared/` for place-agnostic.
- Archetypes (6): events declare `archetypes:[...]`; empty = agnostic. Branch = a
  flag-gated world-state woven into one timeline per scope (not bespoke files).
- `foundByComposition` is the single pure founding seam; `dealComposition` deals the
  diegetic birth's origin from the seed. Save = seed + composition + history; replay
  bit-identical. `buildExpandContext` is the procgen seam — wire there, don't duplicate.
- The CP-R7 harness (`src/sim/harness.ts`) + `artifacts/timeline-audit.json` are the
  acceptance gate for all breadth. Canonical architecture: `docs/STATE.md`.
